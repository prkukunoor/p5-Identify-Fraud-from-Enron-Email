# p5-Identify-Fraud-from-Enron-Email
In this project, I played detective, and put my machine learning and programming skills to use, by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset. This project taught me the end-to-end process of investigating data through a machine learning lens, how to extract and identify useful features that best represent my data, a few of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms today, among which Gaussian naive bayes, Decision Trees and K nearest neighbors. And finally how to evaluate the performance of my machine learning algorithms.
